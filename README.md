InnerSource Atlas is a map-first discovery tool for large engineering organisations.
It visualises domains, systems, and repositories as a navigable topology, and pairs this with an AI assistant that can answer grounded questions like “what should I reuse?”, “who owns this?”, and “is this safe to depend on?”.

Atlas combines structured metadata, live repository signals, and semantic search over documentation — using deterministic, read-only tools to ensure answers are explainable and trustworthy.
